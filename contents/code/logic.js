// Power management functionality for Caffeine Panel Icon
// 
// Note: This file is kept for compatibility but the actual functionality
// is now handled by caffeine-toggle.sh script which provides a more
// reliable and less intrusive approach to preventing system suspension.
//
// The script uses subtle X11 server queries every 3 minutes to maintain
// system activity without any visible user interface disruption.
